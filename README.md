# 📚 Java CRUD Project with Swing and MySQL

This is a Java desktop application built with **Swing** and **MySQL** that implements a **CRUD system** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing **books** and **user accounts**.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **User Registration**  
  Users can create their own accounts directly in the application.

- 🔐 **Admin and User Roles**  
  Admins have extended permissions:
  - Create new **user** accounts.
  - Create new **admin** accounts.

- 📘 **Book Management**  
  All registered users can:
  - Add new books to the system.
  - Rate books on a scale from **0 to 10**.

- 🗃️ **CRUD Operations**  
  The system allows you to create, view, update, and delete:
  - Books
  - Users (admin only)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Swing** (Graphical User Interface)
- **MySQL** (Database)
- **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity)

## 🗄️ Database

The application connects to a **MySQL** database to store all user and book information.  
Make sure you have MySQL installed and running.

You'll need to:
- Create the required schema and tables (SQL script included if available).
- Configure database connection details in the source code (host, port, database name, username, password).
